## **Design**

### Database Schema

Based on the user stories and goals above, the following schema was mapped out:

![Database Schema](docs/screenshots/database-schema.jpg)

During development, some changes were made to these models to accomodate the needs of the project:
- **Order**: The `original_cart` and `stripe_pid` fields are not included in the final model, as they were originally intended for use with Stripe webhooks which were not implemented.
- **BlogPost**: The `date` field has been replaced by two fields, `created_on` and `updated_on`. This allows the site users to display both when a post was made, and how recently it has been updated or edited.
- **BlogComment**: The `comment_title` and `comment_body` fields have been consolidated into a `content` field, as decisions regarding the UX/UI rendered comment titles unnecessary.

### Layout
An initial rough layout of the site was then devised, as shown in the following information architecture diagram:

![Information Architecture](docs/screenshots/information-architecture.jpg)

### Wireframes
*Initial wireframes for each of these pages can be found [here](docs/wireframes).*

### Color Scheme
The following color palette was chosen for the site:

![Color palette](docs/screenshots/color-pallette.png)

These colors were chosen to tie in with the nature imagery displayed in the hero image (shown above). Muted colors are used to preserve the desired aesthetic while also ensuring the styling does not draw away the attention of the user from the site's content. 

In terms of accessiblity, the site's text is predominantly in a shade of black (#1C1A1A) against an off-white background (#FAFAFA). This gives a contrast ratio of 16.59:1 per [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), well above the minimum needed to meet [WCAG AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance) standards.

### Fonts
- [Ovo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ovo#standard-styles) - Used in the site's brand logo, hero image and in page headers.
- [Goudy Bookletter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Goudy+Bookletter+1911#standard-styles) - Used in sub-headings and product titles.
- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto#standard-styles) - Used in product descriptions and for any pricing information.

# **Features**
## Authentication & Profiles
- Users can Register for accounts, and verify their emsail address.
- Users can Log in and out with ease.

- Users can view their individual Profile pages, where they can see their Order History and update their default delivery address.

## Shopping & Purchasing
- Users can browse all products in the Catalog.
- Users can use the dedicated Search modal which can be accessed via the navbar to search the database. Search terms are checked against the product names and descriptions.
- Users can order the products by price or by name.

## Product Management
- Site owners can add new products to the Catalog
- Site owners can edit the name, description, price and image of existing products. A placeholder image is displayed if none is provided.

## Blog
- Site Owners can add, edit and delete Blog Posts
- Logged in Users can leave comments on Blog Posts

## Features to Implement
- **Webhooks**: Stripe's webhooks have not been utilized in this site as they are not strictly necessary for the smooth running of the site. However, they are mentioned here as a potential feature to implement in the future as they would be way to build in some redundancy to the checkout process and capture orders that may otherwise be missed due to potential user error or connection issues.
